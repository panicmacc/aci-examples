Gather Info
===========

* Mgmt network info, including:
  * Statically allocated addressing for each APIC mgmt0 interface
  * Statically allocated addressing for each APIC CIMC interface 
  * A dynamic address pool with enough addresses for each spine/leaf mgmt0 interface, plus
    room for expansion.
  * Also allow room on the mgmt network for any L4-L7 devices you may want ACI to communicate with.
* NTP server info
* DNS server info
* SNMP trap destination(s) 
* AAA server info (TACACS+, RADIUS, etc.)
* Syslog server info
* Email relay host info (optional, for Cisco call-home functionality)
* Cisco ID w/ active contract (optional, for Cisco call-home functionality)
* Local administrator password
* Fabric domain name. Arbitrary. e.g.: "ACI_AZ_1"
* Fabric ID. Integer.
  * For multi-site, seems like this is different from "site ID" which must be globally unique. Seems like
    a fabric in one site can have the same fabric ID as a fabric in another site, but should validate that.
* Pod ID. Unique, sequential within the fabric, starting with 1.
* Name (arbitrary, e.g. "apic1") and ID number (1-19) assignments for each APIC
* Name (arbitrary) and ID number (101-199) assignments for each Leaf
* Name (arbitrary) and ID number (201-299) assignmnets for each Spine
* VLAN ID for Infra network (APIC<>Switch and APIC<>vSwitch comms).
  * Infra VLAN ID should be dedicated to the task, and not already in use in the environment.
  * Pick a good one. Changing this value later involves exporting the config and rebuilding the fabric.
  * For multi-site, different fabrics (sites) may use the same infra VLAN ID, assuming the VLANs are isolated
    to each site.
* VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint address pool CIDR, e.g. 10.0.0.0/16
  * Used in Infra VLAN only.
  * Should not overlap with any other routed subnets in the environment.
  * Must be at least /23 (/22 in v2.0(1)) and recommended to be /16.
  * For multi-site, select a different infra CIDR for each fabric/site.
* Bridge domain multicast address pool (GIPO) CIDR. 
  * Must be a /15
  * Valid range: 225.0.0.0/15 - 231.254.0.0/15
  * e.g. 225.0.0.0/15
  * For multi-site, select a different multicast CIDR for each site/fabric.
* ptp addressing for each Border Leaf<>WAN-Dist L3 link
* BGP ASN 

For Multi-Site
--------------

* Cisco-provided OVA file
* 3x vSphere VMs (from OVA)
  * Position VMs for fault-tolerance
  * VMs must be able to reach ACI mgmt interfaces
  * Note: Can name anything you like in vCenter and DNS, but in the VM host OS must be named
    "node1", "node2", and "node3", or else setup will fail.
* For each fabric/site:
  * A unique integer site ID, e.g. 2, 7
  * dtep-mcast /32 IPN-routed unicast IP address assignment
  * OSPF area ID and type (regular, nssa, etc.) for Spine<>IPN adjacency
  * Optional: BGP community name each site should tag to its IPN advertisements. Else can use unknown:unknown:0:0
* For each pod:
  * dtep-ucast /32 IPN-routed unicast IP address assignment
  * dtep-mpod /32 IPN-routed unicast IP address assignment
* For each IPN-peered spine:
  * A physical port assigned for each spine<>ipn link
  * MTU value for spine's ipn link(s)
  * ptp addressing for each of the spine's spine<>ipn link(s)
  * cptep (control-plane tep) /32 IPN-routed unicast address assignment
 

Initial Setup
=============


Enable MP-BGP Route Reflectors
------------------------------

Navigate to System->System Settings->BGP Route Reflector

Configure the BGP ASN, and select which spines you want to act as MP-BGP RRs.


Configuring L3 External (e.g. WAN) Connectivity
===============================================

Create a VLAN Pool
------------------

If the links to your external network device will be VLAN-encapsulated, create a static VLAN pool,
  including any VLAN IDs you'll want to use.

Fabric->Access Policies->Pools->VLAN->Create VLAN Pool

* Select Static Allocation
* Add the VLAN IDs

Create an External Domain
-------------------------

Fabric->Access Policies->Physical and External Domains->External Routed Domains->Create Layer 3 Domain

* Select VLAN Pool created above (not applicable if using routed interfaces)

Create an AAEP
--------------

Fabric->Access Policies->Global Policies->Attachable Access Entity Profiles->Create AAEP
 
* Select the External Domain you created. Click Next.
* Don't select any Interface Policy Groups, yet (we haven't created one, yet). Click Finish.

Create a Leaf Interface Policy Group(s)
------------------------------------

Fabric->Access Policies->Interface Policies->Policy Groups->Leaf Policy Groups

Right-click and select one of:

* Create Leaf Access Port Policy Group
* Create PC Interface Policy Group
* Create VPC Interface Policy Group

Depending on the type of link between your border leaf and your external network device.

Note: For PC and VPC types, you need to create a separate Interface Policy Groups for each PC/VPC.

* Select the AAEP you created in the earlier step.
* Select other Interface Policies as appropriate.
  * If this is a port-channel, be sure to select an appropriate Port channel policy
  * Create new policies, as needed
  * Best practice: Create policies with descriptive names, instead of modifying the "default" policies
  * Caution: Don't modify the LLDP "default" policy, as it's used internally by the fabric.

Create a Leaf Interface Profile(s)
-------------------------------

Fabric->Access Policies->Interface Policies->Profiles->Leaf Profiles->Create Leaf Interface Profile

* Add Interface Selector entries for each Interface you want to apply your Interface Policy Group to
  * Best practice: name your interface selectors after the interface it contains, e.g. "1_59" for int 1/59
* Select the Interface Policy Group
  * Again, be sure you're using separate Interface Policy Groups for each PC/VPC. Since each interface selected 
    specifies an Interface Policy Group, that means that each Interface Profile is also specific to a PC/VPC.

Create/Update Leaf Switch Profile(s)
------------------------------------

Fabric->Access Policies->Switch Policies->Profiles->Leaf Profiles

Select an existing Leaf Profile, or create a new one if needed.

Best Practice: Name your Leaf Profiles after the leaf/leaves they represent. Examples:

* "leaf1" for a profile bound to Interface Profiles that have ports only on leaf 1
* "leaf2" for a profile bound to Interface Profiles that have ports only on leaf 2
* "leaf1_leaf2" fo ra profile bound to VPC Interface Profiles that have ports on both leaf 1 and 2

Once your Leaf Switch Profile(s) are created, add bindings for each of the Interface Profiles you created in
  the earlier step.

Create Tenant
-------------

Tenants->Add Tenant

Create VRF
----------

{Tenant}->Networking->VRFs->Create VRF

* Deselect "create a bridge domain"

Create Global Contract for External Network
-------------------------------------------

_Common Tenant_->Security Policies->Contracts->Create Contract

* Set Scope to Global
* Add Subjects/Filters as appropriate, for e.g. Web_Access

Create an External Routed Network (L3Out)
-----------------------------------------

{Tenant}->Networking->External Routed Networks->Create Routed Outside

* Select VRF
* Select External Routed Domain
* Select OSPF and BGP
* Set the OSPF params (Area ID, Area Type, etc.) as needed
* Select the VRF you created
* Select the External Routed Domain you created

Under Nodes and Interface Profiles, click plus to add an entry.

* Add an entry to the Nodes table for each Border Leaf that will form an adjacency as part of this L3Out.
* If you were using Static routing for loopback reachability instead of OSPF, you could add static routes, here.

Under the BGP Peer Connectivity Profiles table, click plus to add an entry.

* Add an entry for each remote loopback that you want to form a BGP neighborship with.
* The loopbacks must be reachable by either Static routes (added to each Node profile) or OSPF
* Set BGP neighbor options (send-community, BFD-enable, etc.) as appropriate

Under the OSPF Interface Profiles table, add an entry for each Interface with which you'll want to
  form an OSPF adjacency.

* Set OSPF and BFD parameters as appropriate.
* Select VPC tab
* Choose appropriate VPC Interface Profile
* Set VLAN ID for encap (must be in the VLAN pool created earlier)
* Provide each side (both A and B) with an IP address (within a common subnet) they can each
  use to establish an OSPF adjacency with the neighbor. Each leaf will establish and adjacency
  with the neighbor, and with one-another.

Continue to Create External Network step. Add an entry to the External EPG Networks table for each
  External EPG you wish to create. For example, we'll create one EPG representing all networks reachable
  via this neighbor.

* Add a subnet entry to the Subnets table
* Subnet: 0.0.0.0/0
* Check boxes:
  * External Subnets for the External EPG
  * Shared Route Control Subnet
  * Shared Security Import Subnet
  * Aggregate Shared Routes

Add the contract you created earlier, as both a provided and consumed contract.

Save and finish creating routed outside.

Create a Bridge Domain
----------------------

{Tenant}->Networking->Bridge Domains->Create Bridge Domain

* Select the VRF you created in this customer tenant
* Click Next to proceed to L3 Configs
* Add subnets:
  * Provide gateway address
  * Check the "treat as virtual IP" box if you want to use pervasive gw
  * Check "Make this IP Primary" for the primary subnet
  * Set scope to Public
  * Check the "Shared between VRFs" box
* Add the L3 Out you created in the common tenant, to the Associated L3Outs table
* Finish creating BD

(Fabric) Create a Physical Domain
---------------------------------

* Create a Static VLAN Pool
* Create a Physical Domain, binding it to the VLAN Pool. Don't specify AAEP, yet.
* Create an AAEP. Specify the domain you created.
* Create (or open an existing) Access Port, PC, or VPC Interface Policy Group
  * Select Link aggregation type (if applicable)
  * Select your AAEP
  * Choose interface policies as appropriate, including Port Channel settings if applicable
* Create an Interface Profile
  * Add interface selector(s) binding to your Interface Policy Groups
* Create or update a Switch Profile, adding a binding for your Interface Profile

(Tenant) Create an Application Profile
--------------------------------------

{Tenant}->Application Profiles->Create Application Profile

* Give it a name and finish, to acreate the AP.
* Under the new AP, Create an Application EPG
* Under the new EPG, Add a binding to the Physical Domain you created
* Under the new EPG, Under Static Ports, add a binding for the Access Port, PC, or VPC you defined
* Under Contracts, add any Consumed and Provided contracts, including consuming the global "All External"
  Contact you defined under the common tenant.
   

Create an Application Profile
